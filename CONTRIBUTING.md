# Logging Bugs

Anyone can log a bug using the GitHub 'New Issue' button. Please use a short title and give as much information as you can about what the problem is, relevant software versions, and how to reproduce it. If you know the fix or a workaround include that too.

## Code Contribution Flow

We use GitHub pull requests to incorporate code changes from external contributors.  Typical contribution flow steps are:

- Fork the vra-cli repo into a new repo on GitHub
- Clone the forked repo locally and set the original vra-cli repo as the upstream repo
- Make changes in a topic branch and commit
- Fetch changes from upstream and resolve any merge conflicts so that your topic branch is up-to-date
- Push all commits to the topic branch in your forked repo
- Submit a pull request to merge topic branch commits to upstream master

If this process sounds unfamiliar have a look at the excellent [overview of collaboration via pull requests on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) for more information.
